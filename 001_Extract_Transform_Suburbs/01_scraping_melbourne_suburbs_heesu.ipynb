       "<p>Often mistaken for being part of West Footscray or Yarraville, Kingsville is in fact its own small suburb nestled between the two. Residents benefit from being close to both the CBD and coastline, with good public transport and a large cultural sector. Its lower overall ranking compared to 2011 can in part be attributed to the increasingly congested roads. </p>\n",

       "<p><strong>Ranked: 44</strong><br/> Previous rank: 23</p>\n",
       "<p>Kooyong’s considerably lower rank compared to 2011 is mostly due to increased traffic, with the highest proportion of congested roads in the city. Traffic aside, Kooyong remains a desirable place to live, and its ranking would further improve with increased schools in the area.</p>\n",

       "<p>In 2011 Ormond rose to claim the overall #8 position and overtake neighbouring Brighton, only to slip back over 50 spots in 2015. The main reason for its decline is the increased crime, along with the usual culprits of minimal public space and a flat landscape. Public transport, uncongested roads and proximity to schools continue to attract residents to the area, but larger shopping facilities and more cafes would quickly improve Ormond’s overall rank.</p>\n",

       "<p>Close in location to Caroline Springs that places just one rank higher, masterplanned Taylors Hill shares many of the same downfalls. The suburb records very low scores for culture, cafes and tree cover. What it does offer is relatively uncongestedroads and decent bus access.</p>\n",

       "<p><strong>Ranked: 267</strong><br/> Previous rank: 264</p>\n",
       "<p>Taylors Lakes rates well for shopping facilities following the expansion of Watergardens Town Centre in 2007, with good public transport and uncongested roads. The minimal cultural sector, schools, tree cover and poor telecommunications coverage detract from the area’s liveability.</p>\n",

       "<p><strong>Ranked: 166</strong><br/> Previous rank: 97</p>\n",
       "<p>Sandwiched between Belgrave (156) and Upwey (164), the close rankings of these three eastern suburbs can be attributed to the similar attributes they share. All suburbs have obvious natural beauty, with hilly streets, excellent tree cover and public open spaces. The sizeable cultural sector, low crime and decent public transport are also notable strengths of the area.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Templestowe</h3>\n",
       "<p><strong>Ranked: 154</strong><br/> Previous rank: 187</p>\n",
       "<p>The difference in ranking between Templestowe and neighbouring Templestowe Lower is a good example the impact a few points can make. The main category that separates them is proximity to schools, although given Templestowe has better public open spaces and tree cover, its lower ranking can mainly be attributed to its location, being further away from both the CBD and coastline.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Templestowe Lower</h3>\n",
       "<p><strong>Ranked: 123</strong><br/> Previous rank: 85</p>\n",
       "<p>Low crime, good public spaces and leafy streets are the backbone of the safe Templestowe Lower neighbourhood. Added amenity in the area would provide more value to residents, which are currently serviced by small shopping facilities, limited dining options and poor train access.</p>\n",
       "<h3>The Basin</h3>\n",
       "<p><strong>Ranked: 171</strong><br/> Previous rank: 204</p>\n",
       "<p>Nestled among the foothills of Mount Dandenong and the Dandenong Ranges National Park, The Basin forms one of Melbourne’s green wedges. It therefore comes as little surprise that The Basin’s highest scores are for tree cover and topographic variation, along with a low crime rate. The area calls for more shopping facilities and cafes to boost its overall liveability.</p>\n",
       "<h3>The Patch</h3>\n",
       "<p><strong>Ranked: 257</strong><br/> Previous rank: 210</p>\n",
       "<p>Located 39 kilometres east of the CBD, The Patch has only a small population and thus limited amenity. It scores very well for hills, tree cover, culture and has low crime, but needs more schools, public open spaces and shops to truly thrive.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Thomastown</h3>\n",
       "<p><strong>Ranked: 211</strong><br/> Previous rank: 293</p>\n",
       "<p>Thomastown offers residents excellent access to sizeable shopping facilities and is nearby to many schools. What it lacks is cafes, restaurants and tree cover, with a high crime rate and many congested roads. It is disadvantaged by its flat landscape, losing points in the category of topographic variation.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Thornbury</h3>\n",
       "<p><strong>Ranked: 52</strong><br/> Previous rank: 83</p>\n",
       "<p>Thornbury failed to make the top 100 in 2005, but has since jumped considerably to land just outside the top 50. Its biggest strength is its close proximity to schools, followed by the quality telecommunications coverage, buses, trams and large cultural sector. Improved shopping and restaurants would see Thornbury truly thrive.</p>\n",

Despite having close to no public open space, residents benefit from the nearby parks of South Yarra, and given the price, most likely a spacious block.</p>\n",

       "<p>You may have driven through Travancore without even knowing it. This little suburb borders Ascot Vale, providing an enviable location close to the CBD.

       "<p>Tullamarine’s highest score is in the category of cafes and restaurants, followed by great access to buses and trams.

       "<p>Upper Ferntree Gully achieves positive scores for hills, trains and tree cover, but otherwise records consistently below average figures for liveability. The lack of schools, cafes and shops in particular hinders its ranking.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Upwey</h3>\n",
       "<p><strong>Ranked: 164</strong><br/> Previous rank: 105</p>\n",
       "<p>Upwey is located 32 kilometres east of the CBD, close to Belgrave. The suburb carries a sizeable cultural sector, good topographic variation, low crime, excellent tree cover and relatively uncongested roads. On the other hand, it scores very poorly in terms of location, telecommunications coverage and most notably for its almost non-existent shopping facilities.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Vermont</h3>\n",
       "<p><strong>Ranked: 120</strong><br/> Previous rank: 142</p>\n",
       "<p>Being reasonably far from both the CBD and coastline, Vermont makes up for its low scoring location with hilly streets, a low crime rate, tree cover and good proximity to schools.

       "<p>Vermont South’s attributes are similar to nearby Forest Hill, rated just one place above. Families in particular are drawn to the hilly, tree lined, uncongested streets with plenty of open space, but more cafes and trains would improve the overall score.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Viewbank</h3>\n",
       "<p><strong>Ranked: 110</strong><br/> Previous rank: 169</p>\n",
       "<p>Located 15 kilometres north-west of the CBD, Viewbank carries many natural attributes which make for a desirable place to live, with good topographic variation, public open spaces, and even better tree cover. Residents are also in close proximity to schools, although the area would benefit from more eateries and better train access.</p>\n",

       "<p><strong>Ranked: 304</strong><br/> Previous rank: 261</p>\n",
       "<p>Wandin North is disadvantaged by its outlying location, being the furthest suburb in this study from the coastline and is almost as far from the CBD (40 kilometres). Its redeeming features are the excellent tree cover, hills and low crime rate of the area. More schools and a closer train station would help its overall score.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Wantirna</h3>\n",
       "<p><strong>Ranked: 203</strong><br/> Previous rank: 237</p>\n",
       "<p>Wantirna features many congested roads and a small shopping sector, but scores favourably in most other categories assessed. In particular, the area offers excellent tree cover, good access to buses and trams, several dining options and public open spaces such as Koomba Park. A lower crime rate and train access would further improve Wantirna.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Wantirna South</h3>\n",
       "<p><strong>Ranked: 184</strong><br/> Previous rank: 249</p>\n",
       "<p>Wantirna South’s improved liveability compared to 2011 can mainly be attributed to the large shopping facilities of the area, allowing it to overtake neighbouring Wantirna (203) for liveability. It also scores well for cafes and bus access, and has excellent proximity to public open space. Poor scores for train access, crime and congested roads hold back the area from achieving a better overall ranking.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Warrandyte</h3>\n",
       "<p><strong>Ranked: 228</strong><br/> Previous rank: 126</p>\n",
       "<p>Dropping more than 100 places since 2011, Warrandyte has been negatively affected by poor telecommunications coverage and train access, plus the small shopping sector of the area. The suburb maintains some outlying positive scores, most notably for its naturally hilly and leafy setting, along with the great public open spaces and low crime rate.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Warranwood</h3>\n",
       "<p><strong>Ranked: 261</strong><br/> Previous rank: 265</p>\n",
       "<p>Adjacent to Warrandyte South and Ringwood (its name is a conjunction of the two words) Warranwood’s strengths of tree cover, hills and uncongested roads are in keeping with its surrounding suburbs. The suburb would benefit greatly from introducing more shops, cafes and culture into the area and a lower crime rate.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Waterways</h3>\n",
       "<p><strong>Ranked: 301</strong><br/> Previous rank: –</p>\n",
       "<p>Located just east of Mordialloc, Waterways is quite a unique environment. The residential housing development is the only Australian suburb that’s 40 per cent water and 20 per cent parkland, and therefore scores well for public open space. In order to protect the native wildlife of the area, new development (and cat ownership) is strictly monitored, resulting in limited amenity and few schools.</p>\n",

       "<p>Although Watsonia North is slightly further from the CBD and coastline than neighbouring Watsonia (and therefore scores lower for location), the main reason it ranks in the bottom half of suburbs is due to considerably lower scores for train access and congested roads. Its best features are good tree cover, hilly streets and telecommunications coverage.</p>\n",

       "<p>Werribee has only small cultural sector, with almost no cafes, plus a high crime rate, all of which are factors that detract from its liveability.

       "<p>Ranked 208 in 2005 and 172 in 2011, the latest data shows there certainly is more to West Melbourne than its enviable inner city location. Great public transport, shopping facilities, a large cultural sector and cafes have all allowed for the suburb’s rapid rise. What’s keeping West Melbourne outside of the top 50 is its flat landscape with congested roads, plus limited public open space and tree cover.</p>\n",
       "<h3>West Sunshine</h3>\n",
       "<p><strong>Ranked: 239</strong><br/> Previous rank: 233</p>\n",
       "<p>The weakest of the three Sunshine suburbs, West Sunshine is the farthest from the CBD and has a flatter landscape, less tree cover and by far the least amount of schools across the three areas. Sunshine (97) is by far the highest ranking of the three due to its larger shopping facilities, more dining options and far less congested roads.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Westmeadows</h3>\n",
       "<p><strong>Ranked: 167</strong><br/> Previous rank: 234</p>\n",
       "<p>Westmeadows is 17 kilometres north of the CBD between Broadmeadows and Tullamarine Airport. Its strongest assets are the telecommunications coverage and the proximity to public open spaces such as Willowbrook Reserve and Broadmeadows Valley Park. Its cultural sector, however, is almost non-existent, and access to schools and trains is poor.</p>\n",

       "<p><strong>Ranked: 161</strong><br/> Previous rank: 186</p>\n",
       "<p>A major attraction of Wheelers Hill is Jells Park, with its nine kilometres of bike paths. Shopping facilities are also sizeable, with good tree cover and bus access.

       "<p>Masterplanned housing estate Williams Landing is a new addition to the list, 19 kilometres south west of the CBD.

       "<p>Williamstown retains the feeling of a beachside village, despite being just nine kilometres from CBD.

       "<p>The reason Williamstown North’s ranking lags so far behind neighbouring Williamstown (36) is based due to the smaller shopping facilities, fewer public open spaces and less proximity to schools.
